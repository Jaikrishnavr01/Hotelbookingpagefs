      review: "Our family vacation at Habibi  Residency was nothing short of amazing! The kids had a blast at the pool and participating in the hotel's daily activities, while my husband and I enjoyed unwinding at the spa and exploring the local area. The room was comfortable and spacious, and the on-site dining options were delicious. The staff went out of their way to make us feel welcome, and we're already planning our next visit!",
